# Encryption Service

## Overview
The Encryption Service provides a secure and compliant way to manage encryption operations within the MCP system. It handles key management, data encryption/decryption, key rotation, security validation, and compliance checking.

## Features

### Key Management
- Key generation with configurable algorithms and sizes
- Secure key storage and retrieval
- Key rotation and re-encryption
- Key lifecycle management

### Encryption Operations
- Data encryption with multiple algorithms
- Data decryption with proper key validation
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Support for various encryption modes

### Security Features
- Access control for all operations
- Security validation and monitoring
- Compliance checking against standards
- Audit logging of all operations

## Usage

### Basic Implementation
```php
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\EncryptionService;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\AccessControl;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Logging;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Monitoring;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Reporting;

$encryptionService = new EncryptionService(
    $accessControl,
    $logging,
    $monitoring,
    $reporting
);
```

### Generating Keys
```php
$options = [
    'algorithm' => 'AES-256-GCM',
    'key_size' => 256,
];

$key = $encryptionService->generateKey($options);
```

### Encrypting Data
```php
$data = 'sensitive data';
$options = [
    'algorithm' => 'AES-256-GCM',
    'key_id' => 'key-123',
];

$encryptedData = $encryptionService->encrypt($data, $options);
```

### Decrypting Data
```php
$encryptedData = 'encrypted data';
$options = [
    'algorithm' => 'AES-256-GCM',
    'key_id' => 'key-123',
];

$decryptedData = $encryptionService->decrypt($encryptedData, $options);
```

### Rotating Keys
```php
$keyId = 'key-123';
$options = [
    'algorithm' => 'AES-256-GCM',
    'key_size' => 256,
];

$result = $encryptionService->rotateKey($keyId, $options);
```

### Validating Security
```php
$options = [
    'algorithm' => 'AES-256-GCM',
    'key_id' => 'key-123',
];

$securityResults = $encryptionService->validateSecurity($options);
```

### Checking Compliance
```php
$options = [
    'standards' => ['FIPS-140-2', 'NIST'],
    'regulations' => ['GDPR', 'HIPAA'],
    'policies' => ['internal', 'external'],
];

$complianceResults = $encryptionService->checkCompliance($options);
```

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Permission-based access to all operations
- Role-based access control integration
- Audit logging of access attempts
- Secure key storage and retrieval

### Monitoring
- Real-time monitoring of encryption operations
- Security validation checks
- Performance monitoring
- Resource usage tracking

### Reporting
- Compliance reports
- Security validation reports
- Audit logs
- Performance metrics

## Testing
Run the test suite using PHPUnit:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/MCP/Agentic/Core/Services/EncryptionServiceTest.php
```

The test suite covers:
- Key generation and management
- Encryption and decryption operations
- Key rotation
- Security validation
- Compliance checking
- Error handling
- Access control
- Logging

## Error Handling
The service includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Access denial
- Invalid keys
- Encryption/decryption failures
- Key rotation errors
- Security validation failures
- Compliance violations

## Best Practices

### Configuration
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256-GCM recommended)
- Implement proper key rotation policies
- Configure appropriate access controls
- Set up monitoring and alerting

### Implementation
- Always validate input data
- Use secure key storage
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow security best practices

### Maintenance
- Regular security audits
- Key rotation schedule
- Compliance checks
- Performance monitoring

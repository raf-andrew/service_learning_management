# Maintenance Agent

## Overview

The Maintenance Agent is responsible for managing system maintenance tasks, including scheduling, execution, health validation, reporting, and issue tracking. It ensures that maintenance operations are performed safely and efficiently while maintaining system stability.

## Components

### MaintenanceAgent Class

The `MaintenanceAgent` class provides the following core functionalities:

- Task scheduling and management
- Task execution with health validation
- System health monitoring
- Issue tracking and reporting
- Access control integration
- Comprehensive logging

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```php
use MCP\Agentic\Agents\Operations\MaintenanceAgent;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\AccessControl;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Logging;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Monitoring;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Scheduling;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\Reporting;
use MCP\Agentic\Core\Services\IssueTracking;

$agent = new MaintenanceAgent(
    $accessControl,
    $logging,
    $monitoring,
    $scheduling,
    $reporting,
    $issueTracking
);
```

### Scheduling Maintenance Tasks

```php
$tasks = [
    [
        'name' => 'Database Backup',
        'priority' => 'high',
        'schedule' => 'daily',
        'steps' => [
            [
                'type' => 'database',
                'action' => 'backup',
            ],
        ],
    ],
];

$scheduledTasks = $agent->scheduleMaintenance($tasks);
```

### Executing Maintenance Tasks

```php
$task = [
    'name' => 'System Cleanup',
    'steps' => [
        [
            'type' => 'cache',
            'action' => 'clear',
        ],
    ],
];

$result = $agent->executeTask($task);
```

## Features

### Task Management

- Schedule maintenance tasks with priorities
- Define task dependencies
- Configure notifications
- Track task execution status

### Health Validation

- Pre-execution health checks
- Post-execution health validation
- Metric-based health assessment
- Issue severity determination

### Maintenance Steps

The agent supports various types of maintenance steps:

1. Database Maintenance
   - Backups
   - Optimization
   - Cleanup

2. Cache Maintenance
   - Clearing
   - Optimization
   - Validation

3. File Maintenance
   - Cleanup
   - Compression
   - Validation

4. Service Maintenance
   - Updates
   - Restarts
   - Configuration

### Security

- Access control integration
- Permission-based task execution
- Secure task scheduling
- Audit logging

### Monitoring

- System health metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Resource utilization
- Service status

### Reporting

- Maintenance reports
- Health validation reports
- Issue tracking
- Performance metrics

## Testing

The Maintenance Agent includes comprehensive test coverage:

```bash
php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/MCP/Agentic/Agents/Operations/MaintenanceAgentTest.php
```

Test cases cover:

- Task scheduling
- Task execution
- Health validation
- Access control
- Error handling
- Issue tracking

## Error Handling

The agent implements robust error handling:

- Access control validation
- Health check failures
- Task execution errors
- Step validation
- Issue tracking

## Best Practices

### Configuration

1. Define clear maintenance schedules
2. Set appropriate task priorities
3. Configure health thresholds
4. Set up notifications

### Implementation

1. Use proper access control
2. Implement comprehensive logging
3. Monitor system health
4. Track and resolve issues

### Maintenance

1. Regular health checks
2. Proactive monitoring
3. Issue resolution
4. Performance optimization

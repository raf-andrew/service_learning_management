# Test Coverage Analysis Agent

## Overview
The Test Coverage Analysis Agent is responsible for:
- Analyzing test coverage
- Tracking coverage metrics
- Identifying uncovered code
- Suggesting test improvements
- Generating coverage reports
- Monitoring coverage trends
- Ensuring 100% coverage

## Implementation Details

### Core Functionality
1. Coverage Analysis
   - Line coverage
   - Branch coverage
   - Function coverage
   - Class coverage
   - Method coverage
   - Statement coverage
   - Path coverage

2. Coverage Metrics
   - Coverage percentage
   - Uncovered lines
   - Partially covered lines
   - Critical paths
   - Edge cases
   - Boundary conditions
   - Error conditions

3. Coverage Reporting
   - Coverage summary
   - Coverage details
   - Coverage trends
   - Coverage history
   - Coverage comparison
   - Coverage recommendations

4. Test Improvement
   - Missing test suggestions
   - Test case generation
   - Test optimization
   - Test prioritization
   - Test maintenance
   - Test documentation

5. Coverage Monitoring
   - Real-time coverage
   - Coverage alerts
   - Coverage thresholds
   - Coverage goals
   - Coverage tracking
   - Coverage validation

### Integration Points
1. Test Framework
   - PHPUnit integration
   - Test runner integration
   - Test suite integration
   - Test case integration
   - Test result integration

2. Version Control
   - Git integration
   - Commit analysis
   - Branch analysis
   - Merge analysis
   - Coverage history

3. CI/CD Pipeline
   - Build integration
   - Test integration
   - Coverage checks
   - Coverage gates
   - Coverage reports

4. Monitoring
   - Coverage monitoring
   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource monitoring
   - Test monitoring
   - System monitoring

### Security Considerations
- No access to sensitive data
- No access to production credentials
- No access to user data
- No access to billing information
- No access to tenant data

### Performance Requirements
- Analysis completion within 5 minutes
- Report generation within 2 minutes
- Real-time feedback for small changes
- Batch processing for large changes
- Minimal impact on system performance

### Success Criteria
- Accurate coverage analysis
- Reliable coverage tracking
- Complete coverage reporting
- Effective test suggestions
- Zero false positives
- 100% test coverage

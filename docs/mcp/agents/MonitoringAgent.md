# Monitoring Agent

## Overview
The Monitoring Agent is responsible for monitoring the health, performance, and resource utilization of the MCP framework and its components. It provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities including system monitoring, performance monitoring, error tracking, alert management, and health checks.

## Capabilities

### System Monitoring
- System resource monitoring
- Process monitoring
- Service status tracking
- Network monitoring
- Storage monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
- Response time tracking
- Throughput monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Performance trend analysis

### Error Tracking
- Error detection
- Error classification
- Error reporting
- Error trend analysis
- Error resolution tracking

### Alert Management
- Alert generation
- Alert classification
- Alert routing
- Alert escalation
- Alert resolution

### Health Checks
- Service health validation
- Dependency health checking
- System health assessment
- Health status reporting
- Health trend analysis

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK Stack for logging
- AlertManager for alerting
- Node Exporter for system metrics

### Access Control
- Read-only access to monitoring data
- No access to production data
- Human review required for:
  - Alert threshold changes
  - Monitoring configuration changes
  - Health check modifications
  - Alert routing changes

### Integration Points
- Monitoring systems
- Logging systems
- Alert systems
- CI/CD pipeline
- Reporting systems

### Output Formats

- Alert management workflow
- Health check workflow

## Security Considerations
- No access to sensitive data
- No access to production credentials
- No access to user data
- No access to billing information
- No access to tenant data

## Performance Requirements
- Monitoring data collection within 1 minute
- Performance metrics collection within 30 seconds
- Error detection within 15 seconds
- Alert generation within 5 seconds
- Health check completion within 10 seconds

## Success Criteria

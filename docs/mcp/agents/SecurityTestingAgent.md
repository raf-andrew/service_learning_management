# Security Testing Agent

## Overview
The Security Testing Agent is responsible for analyzing and validating the security of the MCP framework and its components. It provides comprehensive security testing capabilities including vulnerability scanning, security validation, compliance checking, security reporting, and remediation tracking.

## Capabilities

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Code vulnerability detection
- Dependency vulnerability analysis
- Configuration vulnerability checking
- API security testing
- Database security validation

### Security Validation
- Authentication testing
- Authorization validation
- Input validation testing
- Output sanitization checking
- Session management testing

### Compliance Checking
- Security standard compliance
- Data protection compliance
- Access control compliance
- Audit trail validation
- Policy enforcement checking

### Security Reporting
- Vulnerability reports
- Compliance reports
- Risk assessment
- Security metrics
- Trend analysis

### Remediation Tracking
- Issue tracking
- Fix verification
- Patch management
- Security updates
- Resolution monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
- SonarQube for code analysis
- PHP_CodeSniffer for security standards
- PHPStan for static analysis
- PHPUnit for security testing

### Access Control
- Read-only access to security metrics
- No access to production data
- Human review required for:
  - Security threshold changes
  - Vulnerability fixes
  - Compliance updates
  - Policy changes

### Integration Points
- Security monitoring systems
- Logging systems
- Alert systems
- CI/CD pipeline
- Reporting systems

### Output Formats
- Security reports
- Compliance reports
- Vulnerability alerts
- Risk assessments
- Remediation guides

# Test Execution Agent

## Overview
The Test Execution Agent is responsible for managing and executing test suites within the MCP framework. It provides automated test scheduling, execution, failure reporting, coverage tracking, and test optimization capabilities.

## Capabilities

### Test Scheduling
- Test suite scheduling
- Priority-based execution
- Resource allocation
- Dependency management
- Schedule optimization

### Test Execution
- Unit test execution
- Integration test execution
- End-to-end test execution
- Performance test execution
- Security test execution

### Failure Reporting
- Detailed failure analysis
- Error categorization
- Stack trace analysis
- Environment state capture
- Failure reproduction steps

### Coverage Tracking
- Line coverage monitoring
- Branch coverage tracking
- Path coverage analysis
- Dead code detection
- Coverage trend analysis

### Test Optimization
- Test suite optimization
- Execution time optimization
- Resource usage optimization
- Test case prioritization
- Redundant test removal

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- PHPUnit for test execution
- PHP-Code-Coverage for coverage analysis
- PHP-Parser for code analysis
- PHPStan for static analysis
- PHP_CodeSniffer for code style

### Access Control
- Read-only access to test files
- No write access to production code
- Human review required for:
  - Test modifications
  - Coverage threshold changes
  - Test optimization decisions

### Integration Points
- Version control system
- CI/CD pipeline
- Test execution system
- Coverage reporting system
- Code review system

### Output Formats
- Test execution reports
- Coverage reports
- Failure reports
- Optimization suggestions
- Performance metrics

## Testing Strategy

- Integration workflow
- Human review workflow

## Security Considerations
- No access to sensitive data
- No access to production credentials
- No access to user data
- No access to billing information
- No access to tenant data

## Performance Requirements
- Test execution within 5 minutes
- Coverage analysis within 1 minute
- Test optimization within 30 seconds
- Real-time feedback for small changes
- Batch processing for large changes

## Success Criteria
- 100% test coverage
- Zero false positives in test execution
- Complete failure reporting
- Accurate coverage tracking
- Efficient test optimization
- Reliable test execution

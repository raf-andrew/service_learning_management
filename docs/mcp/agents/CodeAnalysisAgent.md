# Code Analysis Agent

## Overview
The Code Analysis Agent is responsible for analyzing code quality, identifying potential issues, and generating documentation. It operates within the MCP framework to provide automated code analysis and improvement suggestions.

## Capabilities

### Static Analysis
- Syntax validation
- Type checking
- Dependency analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code style validation

### Complexity Metrics
- Cyclomatic complexity calculation
- Cognitive complexity assessment
- Maintainability index
- Code duplication detection
- Class/method size analysis

### Code Smell Detection
- Long method detection
- Large class detection
- Duplicate code identification
- Dead code detection
- Magic number/string detection
- Inappropriate intimacy detection

### Best Practice Validation
- SOLID principles compliance
- Design pattern usage
- Naming convention adherence
- Documentation completeness
- Error handling practices
- Security best practices

### Documentation Generation
- PHPDoc generation
- API documentation
- Architecture diagrams
- Dependency graphs
- Change logs

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- PHP_CodeSniffer for code style analysis
- PHPMD for mess detection
- PHPStan for static analysis
- PHPLOC for metrics
- PHPUnit for test coverage
- Graphviz for dependency visualization

### Access Control
- Read-only access to codebase
- No write access to production code
- Human review required for:
  - Code style changes
  - Documentation updates
  - Architecture modifications

### Integration Points
- Version control system
- CI/CD pipeline
- Documentation system
- Issue tracking system
- Code review system

### Output Formats
- JSON reports
- HTML documentation
- Markdown files
- XML analysis results
- PDF reports

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Static analysis accuracy
- Metric calculation correctness
- Code smell detection precision
- Best practice validation logic
- Documentation generation quality

### Integration Tests
- Version control system integration
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Documentation system integration
- Issue tracking system integration
- Code review system integration

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete analysis workflow
- Documentation generation workflow
- Report generation workflow
- Integration workflow
- Human review workflow

## Security Considerations
- No access to sensitive data
- No access to production credentials
- No access to user data
- No access to billing information
- No access to tenant data

## Performance Requirements
- Analysis completion within 5 minutes
- Documentation generation within 2 minutes
- Report generation within 1 minute
- Real-time feedback for small changes
- Batch processing for large changes

## Success Criteria
- 100% test coverage
- Zero false positives in analysis
- Complete documentation generation
- Accurate metric calculation
- Reliable code smell detection
- Efficient best practice validation

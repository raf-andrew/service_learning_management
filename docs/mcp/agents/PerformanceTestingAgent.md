- Breaking point identification
- Recovery testing
- Resource exhaustion testing
- Error handling validation

### Bottleneck Identification
- CPU usage analysis
- Memory utilization tracking
- I/O performance monitoring
- Network latency analysis
- Database performance analysis

### Performance Reporting
- Real-time metrics collection
- Historical trend analysis
- Performance comparison
- Resource usage reporting
- Response time analysis

### Optimization Suggestions
- Code optimization recommendations
- Resource allocation suggestions
- Cache optimization proposals
- Query optimization advice
- Configuration tuning recommendations

# Deployment Automation Agent

## Overview

The Deployment Automation Agent is responsible for automating and managing the deployment process across different environments. It ensures safe, reliable, and consistent deployments while maintaining a comprehensive history and metrics of all deployment activities.

## Responsibilities

1. **Deployment Automation**
   - Automates the deployment process across environments
   - Manages deployment configurations
   - Handles deployment rollbacks
   - Ensures deployment security

2. **Health Monitoring**
   - Monitors deployment health
   - Verifies application health
   - Checks database health
   - Validates cache health
   - Monitors queue health
   - Ensures service health

3. **Reporting and Metrics**
   - Generates deployment reports
   - Tracks deployment history
   - Maintains deployment metrics
   - Provides deployment summaries

## Features

### Deployment Process

1. **Pre-deployment Checks**
   - Validates environment
   - Checks git status
   - Verifies dependencies
   - Runs tests
   - Checks migrations
   - Validates resources

2. **Deployment Execution**
   - Pulls latest changes
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs migrations
   - Clears caches
   - Updates version

3. **Post-deployment Verification**
   - Verifies application health
   - Checks database health
   - Validates cache health
   - Monitors queue health
   - Ensures service health

### Rollback Process

1. **Pre-rollback Checks**
   - Validates environment
   - Verifies version
   - Checks git status

2. **Rollback Execution**
   - Checks out target version
   - Installs dependencies
   - Rolls back migrations
   - Clears caches

3. **Post-rollback Verification**
   - Verifies application health
   - Checks database health
   - Validates cache health
   - Monitors queue health
   - Ensures service health

### Metrics and Reporting

1. **Deployment Metrics**
   - Deployments completed
   - Deployments failed
   - Rollbacks performed
   - Deployment time
   - Verification time
   - Rollback time
   - Deployment success rate

2. **Environment Metrics**
   - Deployments by environment
   - Deployments by status
   - Deployments by type

3. **Deployment History**
   - Environment
   - Version
   - Branch
   - Commit
   - Timestamp
   - Status
   - Metrics

## Configuration

### Environment Configuration

```php
return [
    'environments' => [
        'development',
        'testing',
        'staging',
        'production'
    ],
    'allow_production_deployment' => false
];
```

### Deployment Tools

```php
private array $deploymentTools = [
    'git' => 'git',
    'composer' => 'composer',
    'npm' => 'npm',
    'artisan' => 'php artisan',
    'phpunit' => 'vendor/bin/phpunit',
];
```

## Usage

### Deployment

```php
$agent = new DeploymentAutomationAgent($healthMonitor, $lifecycleManager, $logger);

$result = $agent->deploy('staging', [
    'version' => '1.0.0',
    'branch' => 'main',
    'commit' => 'abc123'
]);
```

### Rollback

```php
$result = $agent->rollback('staging', '0.9.0');
```

### Get Metrics

```php
$metrics = $agent->getMetrics();
```

## Error Handling

The agent implements comprehensive error handling:

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Invalid environment
   - Missing configuration
   - Invalid version

2. **Deployment Errors**
   - Failed pre-checks
   - Failed deployment
   - Failed verification

3. **Rollback Errors**
   - Failed checkout
   - Failed rollback
   - Failed verification

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Protection**
   - Production deployment restrictions
   - Environment validation
   - Access control

2. **Deployment Security**
   - Secure configuration
   - Dependency validation
   - Version control

3. **Error Logging**
   - Secure error logging
   - Error tracking
   - Error reporting

## Testing

The agent includes comprehensive unit tests:

1. **Deployment Tests**
   - Successful deployment
   - Invalid environment
   - Missing configuration
   - Failed pre-check
   - Failed deployment

2. **Rollback Tests**
   - Successful rollback
   - Invalid environment
   - Failed checkout

3. **Metrics Tests**
   - Get metrics
   - Metrics structure
   - Metrics accuracy

## Dependencies

1. **Core Dependencies**
   - HealthMonitor
   - AgentLifecycleManager
   - LoggerInterface

2. **External Dependencies**
   - Git
   - Composer
   - NPM
   - Artisan
   - PHPUnit

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Real-time deployment monitoring
   - Advanced health checks
   - Performance metrics

2. **Deployment Features**
   - Blue-green deployments
   - Canary deployments
   - Zero-downtime deployments

3. **Security Enhancements**

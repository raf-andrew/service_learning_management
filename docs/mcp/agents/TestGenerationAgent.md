# Test Generation Agent

## Overview
The Test Generation Agent is responsible for automatically generating and optimizing test cases for the codebase. It operates within the MCP framework to provide automated test generation and coverage analysis.

## Capabilities

### Unit Test Generation
- Method-level test generation
- Property testing
- Edge case identification
- Mock/stub generation
- Assertion generation

### Integration Test Generation
- Service interaction testing
- API endpoint testing
- Database interaction testing
- External service mocking
- State management testing

### Edge Case Identification
- Boundary value analysis
- Error condition testing
- Exception handling testing
- Resource limit testing
- Concurrency testing

### Coverage Analysis
- Line coverage tracking
- Branch coverage tracking
- Path coverage analysis
- Dead code detection
- Coverage reporting

### Test Optimization
- Test suite optimization
- Test case prioritization
- Redundant test removal
- Test execution time optimization
- Resource usage optimization

## Implementation Details

### Dependencies
- PHPUnit for test execution
- PHP-Code-Coverage for coverage analysis
- PHP-Parser for code analysis
- PHPStan for static analysis
- PHP_CodeSniffer for code style

### Access Control
- Read-only access to codebase
- No write access to production code
- Human review required for:
  - Test case modifications
  - Coverage threshold changes
  - Test optimization decisions

### Integration Points
- Version control system
- CI/CD pipeline
- Test execution system
- Coverage reporting system
- Code review system

### Output Formats
- PHPUnit test files
- Coverage reports
- Test execution reports
- Optimization suggestions
- Documentation updates

## Testing Strategy

- Integration workflow
- Human review workflow

## Security Considerations
- No access to sensitive data
- No access to production credentials
- No access to user data
- No access to billing information
- No access to tenant data

## Performance Requirements
- Test generation within 2 minutes
- Coverage analysis within 1 minute
- Test optimization within 30 seconds
- Real-time feedback for small changes
- Batch processing for large changes

## Success Criteria
- 100% test coverage
- Zero false positives in test generation
- Complete edge case coverage
- Accurate coverage analysis
- Efficient test optimization
- Reliable test execution

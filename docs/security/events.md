# Event Security Documentation

## UserProfileUpdated Event (EVT-006)

### Security Considerations

1. **Data Validation**
   - All user input must be validated before event creation
   - Changes must contain both old and new values
   - User object must be valid and authenticated
   - Timestamps must be properly formatted

2. **Access Control**
   - Event can only be triggered by authenticated users
   - Users can only update their own profile
   - Broadcasting is restricted to private channels
   - Event data is sanitized before broadcasting

3. **Data Protection**
   - Sensitive user data is filtered before broadcasting
   - Only necessary user fields are included in the event
   - Changes are tracked for audit purposes
   - Event logging includes security-relevant information

4. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid user objects are rejected
   - Empty or malformed changes are rejected
   - Broadcasting failures are logged
   - Security violations trigger alerts

5. **Monitoring**
   - Event frequency is monitored
   - Unusual patterns trigger alerts
   - Failed attempts are logged
   - Security incidents are reported

### Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   ```php
   if (!$user) {
       throw new \InvalidArgumentException('User cannot be null');
   }
   if (empty($changes)) {
       throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Changes cannot be empty');
   }
   ```

2. **Access Control**
   ```php
   public function broadcastOn(): array
   {
       return [
           new PrivateChannel('user.' . $this->user->id),
       ];
   }
   ```

3. **Data Sanitization**
   ```php
   public function broadcastWith(): array
   {
       return [
           'user' => [
               'id' => $this->user->id,
               'name' => $this->user->name,
               'email' => $this->user->email,
           ],
           'updated_at' => $this->updatedAt->toIso8601String(),
           'changes' => $this->changes,
       ];
   }
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```php
   public function broadcastWhen()
   {
       return $this->user->should_broadcast ?? true;
   }
   ```

### Security Testing

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test invalid user handling
   - Test empty changes handling
   - Test malformed changes handling
   - Test broadcasting conditions

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test event dispatching
   - Test broadcasting
   - Test data integrity
   - Test security measures

3. **Security Tests**
   - Test access control
   - Test data sanitization
   - Test error handling
   - Test monitoring

### Security Recommendations

1. **Implementation**
   - Use proper validation
   - Implement access control
   - Sanitize data
   - Handle errors
   - Monitor events

2. **Deployment**
   - Review security measures
   - Test security features
   - Monitor security events
   - Update security measures

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular security reviews
   - Update security measures
   - Monitor security events
   - Report security incidents

## Business Logic Flow

### User Management Flow
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam linetype ortho

actor User
participant "Login Controller" as Login
participant "User Controller" as UserCtrl
participant "Admin Controller" as Admin
database "User Model" as UserModel

User -> Login: Authenticate
Login -> UserModel: Validate credentials
UserModel --> Login: Return user data
Login -> User: Create session

User -> UserCtrl: Update profile
UserCtrl -> UserModel: Save changes
UserModel --> UserCtrl: Confirm update
UserCtrl -> User: Show success

Admin -> UserModel: Manage users
UserModel --> Admin: Return user data
Admin -> UserModel: Update user status
UserModel --> Admin: Confirm changes

### Course Management Flow
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam linetype ortho

actor User
participant "Home Controller" as Home
participant "User Controller" as UserCtrl
participant "Payment Controller" as Payment
database "Course Model" as CourseModel
database "Enrollment Model" as EnrollModel

User -> Home: Browse courses
Home -> CourseModel: Get course list
CourseModel --> Home: Return courses
Home -> User: Display courses

User -> Payment: Purchase course
Payment -> EnrollModel: Create enrollment
EnrollModel --> Payment: Confirm enrollment
Payment -> User: Show success

User -> UserCtrl: Access course
UserCtrl -> EnrollModel: Verify enrollment
EnrollModel --> UserCtrl: Return status
UserCtrl -> User: Grant access

### Payment Processing Flow
```plantuml
@startuml
!theme plain
skinparam linetype ortho

actor User
participant "Payment Controller" as Payment
participant "API Controller" as API
database "Payment Model" as PaymentModel
database "Course Model" as CourseModel

User -> Payment: Initiate payment
Payment -> CourseModel: Get course details
CourseModel --> Payment: Return price
Payment -> PaymentModel: Create transaction
PaymentModel --> Payment: Return payment link
Payment -> User: Redirect to payment

User -> API: Complete payment
API -> PaymentModel: Verify payment
PaymentModel --> API: Confirm status
API -> User: Show success

## Modularization Strategy

### Controller Responsibilities
1. Admin Controller
   - System configuration
   - User management
   - Course management
   - Analytics

2. User Controller
   - Profile management
   - Course access
   - Progress tracking
   - Certificates

3. Payment Controller
   - Transaction processing
   - Gateway integration
   - Invoice management
   - Refund handling

4. API Controller

   - Data access
   - Webhook handling

### Service Layer Implementation
1. Create service classes for:
   - User management
   - Course management
   - Payment processing
   - API handling

2. Implement interfaces for:
   - User services
   - Course services
   - Payment services
   - API services

3. Use dependency injection for:
   - Service classes
   - Repository classes
   - Helper classes
   - Configuration

4. Implement event system for:
   - User actions
   - Course updates
   - Payment processing
   - API calls

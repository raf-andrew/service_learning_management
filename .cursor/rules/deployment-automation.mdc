# Deployment Automation Simulation

## Project Structure
The deployment automation simulation is organized in the `.simulation/02_deployment_automation` directory with the following key components:

### Core Components
- [DeploymentController.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/app/Http/Controllers/DeploymentController.php) - Handles deployment HTTP requests
- [DeploymentService.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/app/Services/DeploymentService.php) - Contains deployment business logic
- [Deployment.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/app/Models/Deployment.php) - Deployment model
- [Build.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/app/Models/Build.php) - Build model
- [Environment.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/app/Models/Environment.php) - Environment model

### Testing
- [DeploymentControllerTest.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/tests/Feature/Controllers/DeploymentControllerTest.php) - Tests deployment endpoints
- [DeploymentServiceTest.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/tests/Feature/Services/DeploymentServiceTest.php) - Tests deployment service logic

### Configuration
- [checklist.md](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/.job/checklist.md) - Tracks implementation progress and next steps

## Deployment Workflow
1. Create a build with version and artifacts
2. Configure environment settings
3. Initiate deployment through API
4. Monitor deployment status
5. Handle rollback if needed

## Key Features
- Build management and versioning
- Environment configuration
- Deployment process automation
- Rollback capabilities
- Status tracking and monitoring
- Queue-based processing
- Comprehensive test coverage

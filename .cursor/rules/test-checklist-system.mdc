# Test Checklist System Guide

## Overview

The test checklist system provides a standardized way to track test execution and completion status. It is implemented in `.codespaces/testing/.test/checklist-tracking.json`.

## Checklist Structure

Each checklist contains:
- Unique ID for each item
- Description of the test
- Associated test suite and test name
- Current status (pending/completed/failed)
- Last run timestamp
- Completion proof

## Checklist Categories

1. Authentication Checklist
   - ID: auth-001 to auth-003
   - Covers user authentication features

2. User Management Checklist
   - ID: user-001 to user-003
   - Covers user profile and management features

3. Service Learning Checklist
   - ID: sl-001 to sl-003
   - Covers core service learning functionality

## Completion Proof

Each completed checklist item includes:
- Timestamp of completion
- Test result
- Error information (if any)
- Reference to test report

## Metadata

The checklist system maintains metadata:
- Last update timestamp
- Version number
- Total items count
- Completed items count
- Pending items count
- Failed items count

## Integration with Test Runner

The checklist system is automatically updated by the test runner:
1. Test execution starts
2. Results are recorded
3. Checklist items are updated
4. Completion proof is generated
5. Reports are linked

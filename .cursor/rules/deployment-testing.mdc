# Deployment Automation Testing Strategy

## Test Structure
The deployment automation tests are organized in the `.simulation/02_deployment_automation/tests` directory with the following key test files:

### Feature Tests
- [DeploymentControllerTest.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/tests/Feature/Controllers/DeploymentControllerTest.php)
  - Tests deployment endpoints
  - Validates request/response formats
  - Checks error handling
  - Verifies deployment workflow

- [DeploymentServiceTest.php](mdc:.simulation/02_deployment_automation/tests/Feature/Services/DeploymentServiceTest.php)
  - Tests deployment business logic
  - Validates service methods
  - Checks event handling
  - Verifies queue integration

## Test Coverage
The tests cover the following key areas:

### Deployment Process
- Deployment creation
- Status tracking
- Rollback functionality
- Error handling
- Queue processing

### Environment Management
- Environment configuration
- Environment validation
- Environment status tracking

### Build Management
- Build creation
- Build status updates
- Build artifacts
- Build versioning

## Testing Best Practices
1. Use RefreshDatabase trait for clean test state
2. Mock external services and queues
3. Test both success and failure scenarios
4. Validate data integrity
5. Check event dispatching
6. Verify queue job creation
7. Test API response formats
8. Validate error handling

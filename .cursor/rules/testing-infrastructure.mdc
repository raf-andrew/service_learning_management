# Testing Infrastructure Guide

## Test Tracking System

The test tracking system is located in `.codespaces/testing/.test/` and consists of:

- `run-feature-tests.ps1`: Main test runner script
- `checklist-tracking.json`: Checklist and test execution tracking
- `tracking/`: Directory for test execution tracking files
- `results/`: Directory for test reports
- `logs/`: Directory for test execution logs

## Test Suites

The system organizes tests into three main suites:

1. Authentication
   - User Login
   - User Registration
   - Password Reset

2. User Management
   - Profile Update
   - Role Management
   - User Search

3. Service Learning
   - Project Creation
   - Project Management
   - Hours Tracking

## Running Tests

To run the test suite:

```powershell
cd .codespaces/testing/.test
./run-feature-tests.ps1
```

## Test Reports

Test reports are generated in Markdown format and include:
- Test execution summary
- Checklist status
- Detailed test results
- Error information (if any)

Reports are stored in `.codespaces/testing/.test/results/`

## Checklist Integration

The checklist system tracks:
- Test completion status
- Last run timestamp
- Completion proof
- Test report references

Checklist data is stored in `.codespaces/testing/.test/checklist-tracking.json`

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:
1. Add test case to appropriate test suite in `run-feature-tests.ps1`
2. Add corresponding checklist item in `checklist-tracking.json`
3. Implement actual test execution logic

## Test Execution Flow

1. Test suite initialization
2. Test execution
3. Result tracking
4. Checklist updates
5. Report generation

# Product Model Security Review

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
1. Sensitive Data
   - Price information is properly formatted and validated
   - Stock levels are protected from unauthorized modification
   - Metadata is hidden from serialization

2. Access Control
   - Category relationship requires proper authorization
   - Review relationship should be validated
   - Image uploads should be validated and sanitized

### Input Validation
1. Required Fields
   - Name: Required, string, max 255 characters
   - Price: Required, numeric, minimum 0
   - Category ID: Required, exists in categories table

2. Optional Fields
   - Description: String, nullable
   - Stock: Integer, minimum 0
   - Status: Enum [draft, active, out_of_stock]
   - Metadata: Array, validated structure

### Authorization
1. Model Policies
   - Create: Admin only
   - Read: Public
   - Update: Admin only
   - Delete: Admin only

2. Relationship Access
   - Reviews: Public read, authenticated write
   - Tags: Admin only
   - Images: Admin only

### Security Recommendations
1. Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
2. Add request validation middleware
3. Implement audit logging for price changes
4. Add stock change validation
5. Implement soft delete for data retention
6. Add input sanitization for description field
7. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
8. Add CSRF protection for form submissions

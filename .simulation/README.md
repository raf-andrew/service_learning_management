- `12_laravel_controllers/` - Laravel controller simulation
- `13_laravel_middleware/` - Laravel middleware simulation
- `14_laravel_services/` - Laravel service simulation

## Simulation Structure
Each simulation directory contains:
- `simulation.php` - Main simulation script
- `tests/` - Simulation-specific tests
- `.job/` - Job tracking and verification
- `config/` - Simulation configuration
- `data/` - Test data and fixtures
- `reports/` - Simulation results and reports

## Running Simulations
1. Navigate to specific simulation directory
2. Review `.job/checklist.md` for requirements
3. Run simulation: `php simulation.php`
4. Verify results in `reports/` directory

## Verification Process
1. Each simulation includes specific test cases
2. Tests verify both functionality and integration
3. Results are documented in simulation reports
4. Completion is tracked in job checklists

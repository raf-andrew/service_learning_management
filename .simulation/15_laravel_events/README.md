# Laravel Events Simulation

This simulation demonstrates the implementation of Laravel's event system in the Learning Management System. It includes event handling, broadcasting, and queue integration.

## Features

### Event System
- User events (registration, login, profile updates)
- Course events (creation, updates, enrollment)
- Payment events (processing, refunds, subscriptions)
- Notification events (email, push, in-app)

### Event Listeners
- User event listeners (welcome emails, activity logging)
- Course event listeners (instructor notifications, statistics)
- Payment event listeners (confirmations, reports)
- Notification event listeners (delivery tracking, error handling)

### Event Broadcasting
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Queue integration for background processing
- Presence and private channels
- Event queuing and monitoring

## Testing

### Feature Tests
- Event dispatch and handling
- Listener execution
- Broadcasting functionality
- Queue integration

### Performance Tests
- Event dispatch performance
- Listener execution performance
- Broadcasting performance
- Queue performance

### Load Tests
- Concurrent event handling
- Queue worker scaling
- WebSocket connection limits
- Memory usage monitoring

## Running the Simulation

1. Review the checklist in `.job/checklist.md`
2. Run the feature tests:
   ```bash
   php artisan test tests/Feature/Events
   php artisan test tests/Feature/Listeners
   ```
3. Run the performance tests:
   ```bash
   php artisan test tests/Performance
   ```
4. Check the test reports in the `reports/` directory

## Dependencies

- Laravel Framework
- Laravel Echo Server (for WebSocket)
- Redis (for queue and broadcasting)
- PHPUnit (for testing)

## Configuration

The simulation uses the following configuration files:
- `config/events.php` - Event configuration
- `config/broadcasting.php` - Broadcasting configuration
- `config/queue.php` - Queue configuration

## Contributing

1. Review the checklist in `.job/checklist.md`
2. Implement the required features
3. Add appropriate tests
4. Update documentation
5. Submit changes for review

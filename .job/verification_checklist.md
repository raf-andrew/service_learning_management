Build out the infrastructure one simulation at a time complete with tests, work through each element and verify functionality as you go.
Create a .job folder within each to create a checklist of everything that needs to be completed in the simulation. As you verify completion with your tests check each item off and annotate the test file that proves completion.

We need to pay special attention to the laravel components that we've produced to make sure that each element is represented, tested, and functioning as expected.

Make sure you grep our system for existing infrastructure before creating any new. We also want to make use of libraries rather than create our own if possible.
